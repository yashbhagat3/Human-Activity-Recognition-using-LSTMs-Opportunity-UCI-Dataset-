## Human Activity Recognition using LSTMs - Deep Learning
### Successfully designed and trained several neural network models using LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory networks) for recognizing Human Activities by taking raw data from the sensors as a part of the course Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic.

#### 1) Opportunity dataset was used, which required a high amount of preprocessing like differentiating data into training, cross-validating and testing data, handling clusters of NAN values, converting data to its absolute values, eliminating certain similar columns based on their correlation values and converting 2-D data to 3-D for easy training of LSTMs.
#### 2) Hyper-parameter tuning was accomplished by choosing proper dropout, window size for LSTM input, no. of layers and nodes per layer, optimizing function, early stopping, no. of epochs, etc.
#### 3) Models were cross-validated and tested. Various evaluating parameters were calculated which gave accuracy in the range of 80% to 95% achieved an accuracy of 94.8% on the best-trained model.
